BigO.py: This file includes comments that detail the time complexity of each section of the code, which is referenced in the project report.

SAT 2024.py: Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two specified nodes. Additionally, it contains an implementation of the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to determine the shortest paths that visit all towns within a defined radius or complete the traveling saleman problem.

SAT3.py: This file optimizes the time complexity of the SAT 2024.py file by utilizing the Simulated Annealing algorithm to improve performance of Traveling sale man solution.
